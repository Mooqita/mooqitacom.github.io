      <description>The Heidelberg Laureate Forum and Mooqita We are humbled and extremely excited that two of our team members - Markus Krause and Jan Smeddinck - were selected to attend the Heidelberg Laureate Forum 2017. The event is organized by the Klaus Tschira Foundation (KTS) in cooperation with the ACM and multiple other partners. In the spirit of the Lindau Nobel Laureates Meetings the event brings together laureates from computer science and mathematics.</description>
