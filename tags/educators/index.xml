      <description>Mooqita is a platform that connects organizations, learners, and educators, creating meaningful learning experiences by solving real world work tasks. We help your learners to transfer the knowledge and skills you teach them into real world experience by enabling them to solve tasks that come from companies we work with. In the process, the students improve their soft skills by working on larger projects that can&amp;rsquo;t be solved alone, fostering team work, and communication in multicultural groups across different time zones.</description>
