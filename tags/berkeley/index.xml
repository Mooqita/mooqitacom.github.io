      <description>Welcoming Collaboration The Mooqita team is happy to grow - at least for a while - due to four brilliant visiting student researchers from Open Lab and the Digital Civics research initiative at Newcastle University.
Rosanna Bellini, Jan Kucera, Jay Rainey, and Dan Richardson will support the ongoing research efforts around matchmaking, negotiation, and group-work that are concerned with core aspects of the Mooqita process, working with Jan Smeddinck at the International Computer Science Institue (ICSI) at Berkeley.</description>

      <description>We are conducting our first test run with the beta system and have some preliminary results. A total of 158 Students from the BerkeleyX Ruby online course on EdX accessed our website for the experiment. From 88 (~55%) of these students started the challenge, 14 (9%) submitted a solution, and 12 (8%) solutions were correct (solved the challenge), 6 (5%) Students submitted a solution for the second challenge and were invited for the paid group assignment.</description>
